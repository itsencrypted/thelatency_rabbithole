# thelatency_rabbithole

Is an exploration of valuable research being done in the field of latency of P2P Networks in the context of MEV (Maximum Extractable Value).

I'm grateful for this hackathon experience and it pushed me to read and explore things that I had no idea that were happening. A special thanks to Roberto from Alkimiya on Mining Topology; Dalmo from Composable Finance for bytecode reverse engineering chats, thanks to Gonzague from Alkimiya for explaining me in deeper detail all Smart Contracts Vulnerabilities from the paper Extorsionware: Exploiting Smart Contracts Vulnerabilities for fun and profit in detail. Thanks as well to Andrew Cook from five23.io for the valuable insights about Latency issues in Ethereum Mining and MEV extraction and for Alex Obadia from Flashbots team for pointing me to this rabbit hole that I never knew it existed.
